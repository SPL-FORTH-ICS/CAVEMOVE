## Class methods

<!-- ### calculate_rms_mean(x)

Calculates the root mean square (RMS) mean of the given array.

This method computes the RMS mean of the input array x. The RMS mean is 
calculated as the square root of the mean of the squares of the elements 
in x.

**Args:**\
*x (numpy.ndarray):* A numpy array for which the RMS mean is to be calculated.

**Returns:**
*float:* The RMS mean of the input array. -->

### match_duration(n, fs)

Matches the duration of elements in the list n to the duration of the first element.

This method adjusts the duration of each element in the list n to match the duration 
of the first element in the list. If an element is longer than the first element, it is 
truncated. If an element is shorter, it is looped using crossfading to match the duration.

**Args:**\
 *n* (list): A list of numpy arrays where each array represents a signal.\
  *fs* (int): The sampling frequency of the signals.

**Returns:**
 *list:* A list of numpy arrays with matched durations.

Notes:
 - If the list n contains only one element, it is returned as is.
  - The crossfade duration is set to 1 second.
  - The crossfade is achieved using the first quarter of sine and cosine functions.

Example:
```python
  signals = [np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), np.array([1, 2, 3])]
  fs = 44100
  matched_signals = Car.match_duration(signals, fs)
  ```
